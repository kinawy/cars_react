# Creating A Node Package

### Create a new Directory
1. In my terminal I created a new directory.

### Initialize the Node inside the folder
1. I used npm init to initialize Node, then found you can also do  npm init -y to skip this and fill in all the steps later.

### Create an entry point
1. For the sake of continuity I made my entry point index.js although in the future I will probably change that.
2. Then inside my terminal of VS Code, I ran node index.js and it did my console log right in the terminal!!

## This how you use Node, or at least start to use it!!

What Node has allowed me to do is take some of the pressure off of the front end, and gain access to data without using a browser!!
